    "text": "Workshop objectives and outcomes:\nThe objective of this workshop is to equip researchers with theoretical concepts and analytical instruments for evaluating the impact of EHE/ECE on demographic outcomes including morbidity, mortality and migration. The workshop helps participants to get started with querying and retrieving the national dataset of EHE/ECE covering the continental United States over the past 15 years. They will also gain experience in linking this catalog with other data sources such as Census ACS. By participating in this workshop, the attendees would be better able to: Learn about opportunities, challenges and possible solutions in leveraging large scale spatio-temporal data for population-based epidemiological health research. Understand the considerations in integrating, maintaining and retrieval of climatological and socio-demographic data from dispersed and heterogeneous data sources. Learn the sources of uncertainty in identifying extreme climate events and the exposed population in such incidents, and understand strategies to minimize the errors in the impacted population classifications. Formulate their personalized approach to adoption of geoinformatics technology and open source softwares for climate related demographic research."

Lastly, the workshop concludes with a hands-on tutorial on identifying geographic regions and populations affected by extreme heat and cold events using the R programming suite (75 minutes)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Accurate attribution of the areas and populations impacted by climate-related events often relies on distance-based methodologies in which the population of the study unit is assigned temperature data to the closest weather station. We have developed a method that provides a grid-based measure of exposure to extreme heat and cold events called Grid EXposure (GridEX). This approach allows for capturing a more comprehensive representation of thermal comfort and the perceived temperature. GridEX leverages a data science pipeline to gather station-based climatological data and estimate fine-resolution surfaces of ambient (i.e., the air temperature at 2m above the land surface) and apparent temperature (i.e., the perceived temperature by humans, which takes into account humidity and wind in addition to the actual air temperature) with 500x500m resolution. We validated GridEX against station temperature observations from the NOAA Integrated Surface Database (ISD) and re-analysis climate data provided by GridMET. All the derivative data and the associated source code are publicly available."

    "text": "Summary\nStudying how climate change affects us requires accurately identifying areas hit by extreme weather, like intense heat waves. Usually, researchers estimate these conditions using data from the nearest weather station, but this method can be inaccurate. A new approach has been developed that better tracks Extreme Heat Events by using a more detailed temperature measure. This improved method is much more precise, correctly identifying about one million more Californians affected by severe heat each day between 2017 and 2021, compared to the old way."

    "text": "A confluence of factors in aging and health outcomes\nNearly ten percent of Americans over the age of 65 are grappling with challenges linked to aging. This demographic, which includes a substantial number of Medicare beneficiaries, is notably vulnerable to health issues. This concern is growing as the population of older Americans is projected to nearly double by 2050. Simultaneously, the severity and frequency of extreme environmental changes, such as intense heatwaves and cold spells, are hypothesizing to intensify. These extreme weather events can significantly impact the health of older adults, leading to increased mortality and a higher demand for healthcare services, including hospitalization.\nThe situation poses unique risks for our aging population. As the climate continues to change, it’s essential to understand and address the specific health challenges faced by these older adults in the face of confluence of exposome-related events. This understanding is crucial for ensuring that our healthcare system, including Medicare, is prepared to effectively support the growing number of senior citizens in the face of environmental challenges."
